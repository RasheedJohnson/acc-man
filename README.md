# Accounts Manager

    #### **Video Demo:**  <URL HERE>

    #### **Description:** The app allows users to store passwords and account details similar to a password manager, however, it's intended to be a run from an encrypted storage device.

    ##### **Launching the app:** Users can run ```python app.py``` with the terminal opened in the root folder.

    ##### **Usage:**
    The _Add_ button will add the account to both the database (Accounts.db) file and the backup.csv file

    the _update_ button will only function once an item is selected

    ### **Restrictions:**
    The app will not allow users to delete from the **_backup.csv_** file.
    The **_backup.csv_** has to be deleted manually or ammendments need to be made by directly accessing.
